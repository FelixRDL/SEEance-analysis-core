# SEEance Analysis Framework

The analysis framework is the core of the *SEEance* platform as well as the 
developer CLI.

## Requirements

A current installation of nodejs and npm (get it at https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Install

Integrate the published version from npm to your project:
 
`npm install seeance-analysis-core`

**PLEASE NOTE:** Framework usage is currently not intended outside of the described usage scenarios, but if you
want to try implementing it in your projects, have a look at the test procedures
of the analysis plugins, since they represent a very basic way of integration of 
the framework.
